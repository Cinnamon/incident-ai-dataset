# HPG IncidentAI Dataset

## Overview

This project provides a new Japanese IncidentAI dataset for safety prevention on high-pressure gas plant domain. Our dataset comprises NLP three tasks: **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**, **Cause-Effect Extraction (CE)**, and **Information Retrieval (IR)**.
The original dataset was collected from publicly available [reports of high-gas incidents published in 2022 by the High-Pressure Gas Safety Institute of Japan](https://www.khk.or.jp/public_information/incident_investigation/hpg_incident/incident_db.html).

The dataset is annotated by domain experts who have at least six years of practical experience as high-pressure gas conservation managers. These experts possess qualifications as high-pressure gas production safety managers, a national certification demonstrating a certain level of knowledge and experience necessary to ensure the safety of high-pressure gas manufacturing facilities.

The detailed descriptions of each annotation definition for NER, CE and IR can be accessed in our annotation guideline, `HPG_Annotaion_Guideline.pdf`.


## Named Entity Recognition

### Definitions
The NER dataset include six type of entities as following.
